**Welcome to the Pizza Cloud Project**

Welcome to the Pizza Cloud Project, a comprehensive data analytics case study that dives deep into the world of pizza sales!This project showcases how advanced SQL techniques can be leveraged to analyze business data, extract meaningful insights, and drive informed decision-making.

In this project, I worked with a fictional pizza sales dataset to answer real-world business questions, focusing on revenue, order trends, and customer preferences. By using powerful SQL concepts such as window functions, aggregation, joins, and ranking, I was able to uncover valuable insights that are critical for business strategy and growth.

**What You'll Find in This Project**
> A detailed exploration of pizza sales trends, including order volumes, revenue breakdowns, and pizza type popularity.
> Advanced SQL queries that solve key business questions, such as:
> Identifying the most profitable pizza types and sizes.
> Analyzing customer ordering patterns by time and category.
> Calculating the contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

**Key Objectives of the Project**
> To demonstrate the application of SQL in solving real-world analytical problems.
> To provide actionable insights into sales and operational efficiency.
> To showcase the value of data analytics in making data-driven decisions.
> This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also highlighted the importance of understanding data in a business context. Iâ€™m excited to share this journey with you!

Feel free to explore the insights and techniques used, and I hope you find the Pizza Cloud Project as engaging and insightful as I did.
